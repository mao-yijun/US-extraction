US Image Extractor is a specialized open-source application designed to automatically detect and extract ultrasound image regions from medical images. The software analyzes the provided images including standard image formats and DICOM files, identifies the ultrasound region using advanced image processing techniques, and saves the extracted region as a separate image file. This tool is particularly valuable for medical professionals and researchers working with ultrasound data. It helps automatically extract the pure ultrasound region by determining and eliminating patient information and technical parameters, thereby protecting patient privacy and facilitating more efficient image processing workflows.
